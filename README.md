### Your tasks

You now need to implement your layout. The tasks you need to achieve are:

- To display the navigation items in a row, with an equal amount of space between the items.
- The navigation bar should scroll with the content and then become stuck at the top of the viewport when it reaches it.
- The image that is inside the article should have text wrapped around it.
- The article and aside elements should display as a two column layout. The columns should be a flexible size so that if the browser window shrinks smaller the columns become narrower.
- The photographs should display as a two column grid with a 1 pixel gap between the images.

### Hints and tips

You will **_not need_** to edit the HTML in order to achieve this layout and the techniques you should use are:

- Flexbox
- Grid
- Floating
- Positioning
